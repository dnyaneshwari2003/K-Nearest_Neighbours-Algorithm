# K Nearest Neighbours Algorithm (KNN)
## Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Weighted KNN algorithms from scratch (without using libraries) on the Iris dataset.

## Objectives
Implement KNN and Weighted KNN from scratch.
Test and validate models using the Iris dataset.
Analyze performance metrics and visualize results.

## Datasets
Iris Dataset: Used for implementing and testing KNN and Weighted KNN.
Social_Network_Ads.csv: Used for additional testing and model evaluation.
